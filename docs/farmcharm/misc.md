After successfully adding Farm & Charm to your mods, you will be able to discover various new crops species in newly generated chunks. Some of these will be more common, while others will be rarer to find. So keep your eyes open!

Depending on the type of crop, they spawn with varying frequency. While you'll easily find some of these, you may need to take a little trip into the wilderness for others.

The respective wild crops are the perfect source to easily obtain the respective seeds and grains.

# Carts

Carts are a perfect addition to simplify farming.


Currently, there are two different carts with various uses:

**Supply Cart**
Can transport up to 2 players as well as plenty of items and blocks. It can also be used to quickly harvest larger fields: Simply drag the cart over mature crops. The respective drops will then land directly in the cart's chest.

**Plow**
Ideal for creating larger areas of farmland. Drag the cart over grass blocks for this purpose - they will then be converted into farmland.

**Usage**


Press (default) "R" to couple / pick up the cart.

Press (default) "G" to open the chest.

Right-click to sit on the cart.

**Note:** Make sure you're targeting the cart.

The respective hotkeys can be changed in the settings.
